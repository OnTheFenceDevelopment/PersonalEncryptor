# Personal Encryptor v2
This is a follow-on project from PersonalEncryptorCLI which now uses .NET Standard and the libSodium library for encryption

The basic aim of this project is to demonstrate that such programs are fairly simple to develop and is heavily based on sample code generated by [Stephen Haunts](https://stephenhaunts.com) during his [Practical Cryptography in .NET course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-cryptography-dotnet/table-of-contents).

You can read more about my [reasoning behind this project in my blog post](https://www.onthefencedevelopment.com/whatsapp-a-haven-for-paedophiles-and-terrorists) as well as any [posts relating to its creation and ongoing development](https://www.onthefencedevelopment.com/tag/personalencryptorcli/).

Ultimately I will hope to incorporate the core library, now using libSodium instead of the Microsoft encryption libraries, into cross platform Command Line utilies, Desktop and Mobile applications.

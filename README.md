# Personal Encryptor v2
This is a follow-on project from PersonalEncryptorCLI which now uses .NET Standard and the libSodium library for encryption

The basic aim of this project is to demonstrate that such programs are fairly simple to develop. 

It's probably a vain effort to show governments that if they continue with their desires to weaken the encryption through backdoors and compromised ciphers in order to 'catch the bad people' all that will happen is that they will develop their own systems while the rest of us use the horrible broken ones that will result of flawed legislations.

Ultimately I will hope to incorporate the core library, now using libSodium instead of the Microsoft encryption libraries, into cross platform Command Line utilies, Desktop and Mobile applications.
